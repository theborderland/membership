It's an inevitable fact that Borderland grows in popularity faster than we can create the organizational knowledge to host a bigger event.

It's incredibly sad and unfair to have to say no to any single one of you. But sometimes facts are unfair, even in the land between dreams and reality.

All hope is not lost though, as many memberships tend to change hands as the event grows
closer and summer plans change. Also, anyone who won the lottery has the chance to invite a +1 (so now you know who to flirt with). Maybe youâ€™ll find a way to get your membership!

Wow, you won the Borderland lottery! You hereby can purchase a membership for the Borderland, and to invite a friend of your choice to purchase their membership!

Follow this link to purchase your membership! It's valid for 48 hours.

https://{}/{}/{}/redeem?voucher={}

Please note that this is a ~special~ lottery invitation. This means you have to use the same name and birth date as when you registered. For reference, the information you provided was:

  * First Name: {}
  * Last Name: {}
  * Date of Birth: {}

The second voucher you receive is not personal and can be sent to a friend of your choice, so that they may get the possibility to purchase a membership! This can be anyone really, but try to reflect on who would contribute to the co-created event, and/or who would get out a lot from going. This gift voucher has the same 48 hours limit as your original voucher.
