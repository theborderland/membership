# Hello from memberships HQ. It's time to cry.

# It's an inevitable fact that Borderland grows in popularity faster than we can
# create the organisational knowledge to host a bigger event.

# All hope is not lost though, many memberships change hands as the event grows
# closer and summer plans change. This year we're trying a new thing in
# the Secure Membership Exchange Programme (SMEP), where we make it very easy to
# sign up for a waiting list to receive a membership:

# https://memberships.theborderland.se/borderland/2022/waitinglist?item=98

# Note that unlike what I've told some of you before, you have to sign up
# to this list manually!

# That's to make sure you still want to go. A lot of you may want more certainty
# and may already have made other plans. For instance, tickets to our quaint
# little precompression Nowhere goes on sale Saturday.

# Kisses,
# K
