One more thing, we know you applied for *low income membership*; unfortunately, the only chance to redeem a reduced price membership was through winning the lottery. You will still have the chance to get a regular membership, but it will be at the full price. We hope that you'll find a way to afford the normal membership through a +1 or during the first come first served sale. We hope that you'll find a way to afford the normal membership when it comes your way, even if you're low on funds!

        email_body = """Hello from memberships HQ. It's time to cry.

It seems that The Borderland is growing in popularity faster than we can create the necessary cultural continuity and organizational capacity to host a bigger event.

It's incredibly sad and unfair to have to say no to any single one of you. But sometimes facts are unfair, even in the land between dreams and reality.

All hope is not lost though, as anyone who won the lottery has the chance to invite a +1 (so now you know who to flirt with). Feel free to ask for it in a thread in the [FB Borderland Memberships - Info & Support group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1532887430297531). Also, not everyone who won will actually purchase a membership and not all of those who will purchase will offer +1 to someone.

That means that we will have a few hundred memberships left after the lottery concludes, and we will offer those on a first-come-first-serve basis to all those who registered for the lottery but lost - including you. Stay tuned - we will send you an email.

Lastly, have in mind that many memberships tend to change hands as the event grows closer and summer plans change, so maybe youâ€™ll find a way to get your membership transferred! :-)
