# The Borderland Membership Sale

The Borderland is a co-created community event and organisation. We only have participants–there are no spectators, volunteers, artists, or organisers. Besides entry to the event, a membership gives you as much a say in how we organize and what the event is as anyone else.

Since capacity at the event is limited, we raffle off half of the memberships. When you buy a membership you can invite someone. We sell the remaining memberships by invitation.

Please read this description and the FAQ carefully. Some things are different from previous years, particularly how transfers work.

## The Lottery

We conduct the sale in three stages:

  1. Lottery Registration
  
     You can register to take part in the lottery until January 29. 
     
  1. Lottery
  
     A few days after the registration deadline we raffle away half of the memberships. If you're picked you have two days to buy a membership. We'll send you an e-mail notification. 
     If you win you're guaranteed an invite that you can send to someone else.
     
  1. Replicated Sale
  
     We won't sell out in the lottery round. 
     Everyone who buys a membership can invite someone else until we're sold out. 
     It pays to be quick, because we send out invitations starting with the earliest sale.
     
## After We've Sold Out

Memberships are personal. They can only change hands on this website. 

**We do not allow reselling of memberships privately. If you're asked for money somewhere other than on this website you're being scammed!** Contact the membership team if you suspect a scam.

After we've sold out you can register on a waiting list. This is the the *Secure Membership Exchange Programme* (SMEP). When someone refunds their membership you'll get the option to buy it. This list is first come, first served. This is the best and preferred way to get a membership after the main sale.

**We only allow directed transfers in exceptional cases**, see the FAQ. 

The deadline for refunding your membership is two months before the event. After that a fee applies.

# FAQ

## The Sale

### I missed the lottery registration!

Don't fret! Let your camp know and maybe someone has an invitation for you. You can also sign on to the SMEP waiting list.

### I missed the sale!

Register on the SMEP waiting list. A lot of memberships are exchange closer to the event.

### I missed the e-mail with the invitation

The invitation expires after two days. If you miss it, sign up for SMEP and wait for the next opportunity. Remember to check that our messages don't end up in your spam folder.

### I'm a DJ and a fire spinner, can I get a volunteer ticket?

There are no volunteers at the Borderland. Everyone buys a membership, even including everyone on the board! Everyone works together to make the event. Please re-read the Survival Guide *carefully*.

### Last year you asked a bunch of questions during sign up, why is it different?

We'll ask questions when you buy your membership. We don't need that information before then.

### But why is it different?

We're a group of people that enjoy building things and setting them on fire. That–apparently–includes software.  ![You're welcome to change the software if you don't like it](https://github.com/theborderland/membership) (for next year).

## Transfers

### I can't go, what do I do?

On your order page click the "Request Refund" button. 

We'll find someone on the SMEP waiting list that's willing to buy your membership from you. We'll refund the money to your account through our payment provider.

The deadline for refunds is two months before the event. After that a fee applies.


### I really need to give my ticket to a specific person!

On the order page click "Request Directed Transfer" and fill out the form. You'll need to give a reason for the why the membership needs to be transferred. 

A human will check that you're a real person transferring to a different, equally real person. That's to stop people from cheating in the lottery by registering under false names.

We will handle payments and reimbursements. There's no need to arrange to exchange money.


### I'm taking on a reality or a special project. Can you help?

If you're stepping up as a ![realizer](http://realities.theborderland.se/), working with WCH, or contributing special skills to a ![dream](https://dreams.theborderland.se/), feel free to contact the membership team directly. Give a reference and a short description of what you're doing.


### A fee?! What's the transfer fee?

We used to have a hard deadline for when you could transfer memberships.

A lot of people like to hang on to their membership until the very last minute, just in case. That gives the receipients of those memberships very little time to prepare.

Deadlines are harsh though, so this year we're experimenting with a fee instead of a hard deadline.

The fee is progressive the closer we get to the event:
  * Early transfers: no fee
  * Two months before the event: 20% fee
  * One month before the event: 50% fee
  * Three weeks before the event: 75% fee

If you know you're not going to go, give someone else a chance as early as possible!


### Why all these rules?

Turns out a lottery is a little more complicated than a normal sale, we have to work a bit harder so it isn't easy to cheat.


### These rules are draconian, you suck

ok, boomer. 

The Borderland is a co-created, do-ocratic institution. You're welcome to change the rules. Check out the website for more information on how you can take part in the governance.


## I need help!

### I read the FAQ and there's something I still don't understand!

If there's something not related to your order, please use our Facebook group to ask questions. The membership team has very little capacity, so we rely on everyone helping each other out.

### I read the FAQ and there's something wrong with my order!

Contact the membership team at memberships@theborderland.se. Be sure to use the same e-mail address as you've used on this website. Include your order number, if you have one.
