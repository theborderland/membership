# Welcome

The Borderland is an event and year-round community of people who create together. It's the meeting of dreams and realities, doers and ideas. It's a growing community of people of different backgrounds, interests, outlooks and skills.

We're part of a vibrant network of similar events and communities, based on the [10 principles](https://talk.theborderland.se/d/5dDRz8W7/principles) of Burning Man.

# The Practical

Memberships for the Borderland 2022 go on sale May 2022. 

We're still working on some practical details at the moment. Details like how much it will cost, and when the event will be. Subscribe to the newsletter to be kept up to date.

A qualified guess for the next event is week 30, July 25-31 2022, in ALVERSJÃ–, Sweden. Art grant applications open somewhere around May-June.

# Contributing

This event is an empty container for you to fill and play in. 

It's not a festival, there's no line-up, and there are no food stalls. You, together with everyone else, create the Borderland.

There are many ways to contribute, here are some suggestions. Most people do a combination of all these things.

## Theme Camps

Camps are heart and soul of the Borderland. 

They take care of some basic needs for their members, like bringing a kitchen. Some have communal meal plans, others don't.

They also bring and support the people that bring stages, sound systems, art installations, experiences, secret spaces, happy accidents, and everything else that make up the Borderland.

### Joining a Camp

Most camp welcome a certain number of newcomers each year. You can find camps to join in your local community, and on our Facebook group. Closer to the event there's usually a big spreadsheet with descriptions and contact points.

### Creating a Camp

You can create your own camp. Check out the [Camp Wisdom group](https://talk.theborderland.se/g/M2cnqJ5v/camp-wisdom) for great advice, previous experiences, and discussions.

Some people create very small ad-hoc camps, which is called free-camping.

## Dreams, Events and Art Projects

We have many performers and artists that experiment and build at the Borderland. If you want to perform check out what camps have venues that might be a good fit, then add your event to the guide.

### What Where When Guide

The [WWW Guide](https://guide.theborderland.se) contains everything that happens at the Borderland. Well, some of the things. A few at least. 

Everyone can add events to it.

### Getting a Grant

Part of the membership price is directed towards grants that are allocated by the community.

The [dreams platform](https://dreams.theborderland.se/) for 2022 isn't open yet, but meanwhile you can check out last year's applications.

### Practical Advice for Building things

< help, someone fill this out >

## Frame Making

The Borderland is an empty container to fill with fun and fantastic things. A lot of energy goes into making that container, and nobody gets paid.

We're a decentralised and volunteer organisation. Most of the time no one will ask you do to any of these things, but pick a task and start doing it and everyone will start cheering for you.

### Before the event

If you're a spreadsheet aficionado, fluent in Danish, interested in urban planning, heavy machinery, or have other special skills, we need you! 

Our [realities platform](http://realities.theborderland.se/) contain a graph of all things that needs to be done for the event to happen. 

It has contact points for more information if you see something that feels like you.

### During the event

There's a lot of shifts to be taken during the event. Like making sure everyone's safe, building structures, greeting people when they arrive. 

When you buy your membership you can opt in to be contacted about certain opportunities.


# Joining the year-round community 

Find your local groups, they're the best. Look around for your local Burning Man groups and meetups on Facebook and elsewhere.

We have a [big Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/theborderland/), which is an invaluable resource for finding each other and getting information out.

Note that the Borderland is a diverse crowd make out of different groupings and people. Some are at odds with each other politically, spiritually, and personally. That's the way we like it. We don't care so much about what you say, wear, or think. We do care about what you build and what you bring, and if it's fun or profound.

That said, the Facebook group does contain talk, and sometimes gets heated. Do not feed the trolls, keep doing what you're doing.
