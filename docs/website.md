# Welcome

The Borderland is the place between dreams and realities, doers and ideas, participation and initiation. It's a growing community of people of different backgrounds, interests, outlooks, and skills. It’s also an annual event created by the participants themselves, and a larger year-round community of people in the process of creating together.

The Borderland is part of a vibrant network of similar events and communities, based on the [10 principles](https://talk.theborderland.se/d/5dDRz8W7/principles) of Burning Man.


# The Practical

The Borderland 2022 will take place in Alversjö, Sweden, during week 30 (July 25 to 31). Memberships for the Borderland 2022 will go on sale in May 2022.

To get a membership, you have to register for the Membership Lottery during week 17. When you have registered for the Lottery, you might get a chance to purchase a membership when the sale begins in the beginning of May.

We’re still working on some of the practical details. Keep yourself updated by subscribing to the newsletter [link].

# Co-creation and contribution

The Borderland is an empty container for you to fill with content. Nothing will happen without contribution from the participants, and everyone with a membership is a co-creator of the event. There are no food-stalls, no line-up and no hostels. You, together with everyone else, create the Borderland.

There are many ways to contribute. You can take on one of the many responsibilities to bless the event and the community with your skills and time (for and overview of some practical things that needs to be done, see the Realities platform: https://coda.io/d/Realities-2022_dFvRNS5423Z/Responsibilities_sulZB#_luxNx )
Also join The Borderland discord to find out how to contribute: https://discord.gg/u5fJ6jY4eC

You can also contribute by creating art, organizing a kitchen for your camp, hosting workshops, being present and profound or in whatever way you personally have time, energy and desire to. We’re all doing it together.

## Camps

Camps are, in a way, the heart and soul of the Borderland. This is where people gather in groups to create a life for each other during the Borderland week. Quite often camps take care of the basic needs together (like bringing a kitchen and cooking together, making showers, etc). Many camps have a theme or a project that they work on together, to gift something to the event as a group. And some camps are just a couple of friends who wish to experience the Borderland together.

The camps are usually the initiatives that bring stages, sound systems, art installations, experiences, secret spaces, happy accidents, wacky performances and everything else that makes up the Borderland.

Why not join one, or perhaps create one of your own?


### Creating a Camp
ining a Camp

Many camps are glad to welcome newcomers each year. You can find camps to join in your local community, or in our Facebook group: “Camp Matchmaking Agency” [https://www.facebook.com/groups/2080911315480407/]. Closer to the event, there is sometimes (if someone arranges it) a big spreadsheet with descriptions and contact points to camps who wish to share their information.

### Creating a Camp

You can always create your own camp! Check out the [Camp Wisdom group](https://talk.theborderland.se/g/M2cnqJ5v/camp-wisdom) for great advice, previous experiences, and discussions. How do you want to do the Borderland?

Some people create very small ad-hoc camps, or camp alone, which is called free camping.

## Dreams, Events, and Art Projects

Anything is possible at the Borderland, and there are always a whole bunch of artists, performers and dreamers that experiment and build their specific projects at the event. If you have a cool project without the means to realize it, feel free to reach out to the community and you might find some support!

If you wish to perform somewhere, it might be a good idea to check out which camps have venues that might be a good fit. There is usually a (member-organized) guide to what happens at the Borderland, where you can write up your performance before hand.


### What Where When Guide

The [WWW Guide](https://guide.theborderland.se) is a member-organized FOMO-guide, to collect all the weird things taking place at the Borderland. All participants can write up their projects, workshops, happenings, performances, and whatever else here.

However, remember that the Borderland is completely membership-driven, so the WWW Guide will only happen if someone takes initiative for it. And it will only contain what people actually write up in it.

### Getting a Grant

Quite a large part of the membership fee is directed towards funding for projects. This funding is directly allocated by the members themselves. This means that any member can share their project (together with a budget), and any member can “vote” on which projects are to be funded. And just like that, we’re shaping the Borderland together!

All this takes place at the Dreams platform, which is especially designed for this specific purpose. The [dreams platform](https://dreams.theborderland.se/) for 2022 isn't open yet, but meanwhile, you can check out last year's applications.

## The Empty Frame of the Borderland

The Borderland is basically an empty frame for anyone to fill with fun and fantastic things. But this framework takes a lot of energy to make, and nobody gets paid.

We’re a decentralized organization run by volunteers. Most of the time, nobody will ask you to do anything. But there’s always something to be done, so just pick a task and start doing it. You’ll soon hear the cheers of the community, with all their appreciation and love!

So if you ever get the feeling that this specific thing is needed/would be fun, just put on your daring gloves and make it happen!

### Before the event

If you're a spreadsheet aficionado, fluent in Swedish, interested in urban planning, heavy machinery, or have other special skills, we need you! Our [realities platform](http://realities.theborderland.se/) contains a graph of all the things that need to be done for the event to happen. 

Check it out for contact information for someone who might help you proceed if you see a responsibility that speaks to you.

### During the event

There are a lot of different kinds of shifts to take during the event. This is a great way to feel more involved, to contribute with your time, and to meet new people! Why not take a shift with the Clown Police, making sure everything is fun and dandy? Or spend some time hosting the Sanctuary to support the people who might not feel so good right now? Or help out building structures, keeping the place clean, or greeting people when they arrive to the burn? 

When you purchase your membership, you can opt in to be contacted about certain possible responsibilities.

# Joining the year-round community 

It might be hard to come home from the Borderland, and everyday life may seem bleak after all the sparkles at the playa. But don’t worry, there are a lot of local groups and communities with connections to Borderland or similar events, all around the world. Look around for you local Burning Man groups or meetups! You can usually find them on Facebook, or ask around among friends.

We have a [big Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/theborderland/), which is an invaluable resource for finding each other and getting information out.

Please note that the Borderland is a diverse crowd made out of very different groups of people. Some might even be at odds with each other, politically, spiritually, or personally. That's the way we like it. We don't care so much about what you say, wear, or think. We do care about what you build and what you bring, and if it's fun or profound. We’re doing it together!
