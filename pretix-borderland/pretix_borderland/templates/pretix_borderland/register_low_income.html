                    Hey there, everything's hunky-dory in the lottery registration department: we've got you in for the Grand Prize, Hurray! ðŸ’¥

                    But since you're ballin' on a budget... we gotta get some extra deets on you, just some routinary questions you know.
                    Don't worry, these are confidencial, and Membership team and I (the Robot) will treat them with care. Just bear in mind
                    that some human (or a robot) may get in touch to suss out additional info of your earnings and whatnot to see if you're a good fit.
